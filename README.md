# 🌞 Auto-Brite: Smart LED Light Adjustment with Ambient Detection 🌟
Auto-Brite is a smart lighting system that dynamically adjusts the brightness of an LED array based on real-time ambient light levels. Using a photoresistor and an Arduino, this project ensures that the LED brightness increases as the environment gets brighter — creating a natural and seamless lighting experience.

## 🚀 Features
Dual Mode Operation: Toggle between:

Normal Mode: Brighter ambient light increases LED brightness.

Reverse Mode: Brighter ambient light decreases LED brightness.

Real-time Ambient Light Sensing: Continuously reads ambient light intensity using a photoresistor.

Adaptive LED Brightness: LEDs automatically adjust brightness based on surrounding light.

Smooth Transition Algorithm: Filters out sudden light changes to prevent flickering.

Energy-Efficient & Simple Design: Minimal components, maximum impact.

# 📝 How It Works
Light Detection: The photoresistor reads the surrounding light level.

Brightness Control:

Normal Mode: Brighter surroundings → brighter LEDs.

Reverse Mode: Brighter surroundings → dimmer LEDs.

Mode Switching: A pushbutton switch toggles between Normal and Reverse modes.

Smooth Dimming: Smooth filtering ensures a flicker-free experience.

## 🎯 Applications
Smart Home Lighting: Automatically adjusts room lighting based on ambient light conditions.

Mood Lighting for Workspaces: Creates the perfect lighting environment for productivity or relaxation.

Adaptive Display Backlights: Adjusts screen brightness based on surrounding light to reduce eye strain.

Energy-Saving Light Fixtures: Dims lights in well-lit areas to conserve energy.
